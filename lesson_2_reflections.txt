When a repository is initialized, a .git file is added and
allows the user the begin tracking changes between commits.

The staging area is comprised of items within the working
directory which will be committed in a git commit to the
repository. This allows files to exist within the working
directory, but not be a part of the repository. This is valueable
during testing of new features which make sense to exist inside
a different file, but are still being worked on and are too
small to be committed to the repository.

Using the staging area allows users to load their changes
incrementally, with a selected set of files at a time.

Using a branch is useful when creating a different or alternative
version of the project being worked on. It should also come
in handy when experimenting with a completely new aspect that
one would want to add to the project.

Diagrams just give a visual representation of which branches
are currently active, and gives a good indication of any
future merges that need to be addressed once new features
or modes are finished.
