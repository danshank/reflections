When a repository is initialized, a .git file is added and
allows the user the begin tracking changes between commits.

The staging area is comprised of items within the working
directory which will be committed in a git commit to the
repository. This allows files to exist within the working
directory, but not be a part of the repository. This is valueable
during testing of new features which make sense to exist inside
a different file, but are still being worked on and are too
small to be committed to the repository.
