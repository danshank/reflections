Working with a remote repository would allows for easily transitioning
from one location to another, and continuing to work on a project rather
than have all the work created stay in one space. It also allows project
collaborators to work remotely, instead of on the same desktop.

Pulling changes manually instead of automatically lets you make 
conscienous decisions about which branches you want to update. If you're
in the middle of creating a new feature, typically you would want
to push an incomplete feature, since it would be useless for the public.

Forks are copies of other github repositories, whereas clones encompass
any copy of a repository, wherever its located. Branches are different
version of a given repository. Forks are used to begin creating your own 
version of someone else's repository, clones can be used to move
repositories from github to local, or vice-versa.

Local copies of the last known state allows offline usage of the git
repository.

Collaborating without GitHub would involve constantly copying and pasting
new features, or copying new files into a repository. It would be much
harder to make sure things were up to date.

Changes in master usually encompass permanent changes to the project
such as additional features. Typically things like bug fixes should be
addressed in a branch other than master, but sometimes they slip by and
bug fixes are necessary for master. Working in master is like building
the main framework, where other branches help build the components that
you would like to add to the larger framework.
