Working with a remote repository would allows for easily transitioning
from one location to another, and continuing to work on a project rather
than have all the work created stay in one space. It also allows project
collaborators to work remotely, instead of on the same desktop.

Pulling changes manually instead of automatically lets you make 
conscienous decisions about which branches you want to update. If you're
in the middle of creating a new feature, typically you would want
to push an incomplete feature, since it would be useless for the public.
