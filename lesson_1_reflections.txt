Viewing only the specific lines which changed made it so that 
I didn't have to read through lines and lines of identical code.

Being able to see the changes and then look at changes in the
codes functionality from version to version allows tracking
of when features began to break or behave differently

There has to be an intentional save. The greatest benefit of
automatic saving is that it is fairly mindless, but once one
starts to try comparing file to file, they may find that the
specific save points are too close together, and one has to go
back quite a few versions before a certain functionality is
restored.

In Git, there are usually multiple files which are importing features
from one another, so if one changes, it makes sense that the other
interconnected files should change as well. That same instance
isn't the intended use of Google Docs.

git log allows one to view all commits that they've made, as well
as the number of changes between commits and any comments made
on them. git diff shows the precise changes between files.

Making changes that can break something and committing them is
easily reversible since the changes that are made are seen quite
readily.

I want to use git to more easily take the Udacity course, Machine
Learning, and understand other people's code. I also would like
to build a portfolio of my machine learning coding that I plan
to aggregate over the course of the next few weeks.
